**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Feature**: /home/user/repository/nativox-translate/.worktrees/huge-changes/specs/001-agent-translate/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for configuring and persisting prompt settings (system/custom) and their update behavior? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, §PromptSettings]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for how the target language is selected, including any default or validation rule? [Gap, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for back-translation display and storage behavior? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, §TranslationRecord]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for history retention limit and ordering in the UI? [Completeness, Spec §SC-004, §User Story 3]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is “translation result quickly enough” anchored to measurable success criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010, §SC-001–SC-002]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the error banner requirement specific about the retry action (what it triggers)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the agent invocation contract schema fully specified (required vs optional fields)? [Clarity, Spec §Agent Integration]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the deterministic selection rule fully defined for invalid or missing isDefault configs? [Gap, Spec §FR-012]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK009 Do FR-001/FR-002 align with User Story 1 acceptance scenarios without gaps? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001–FR-002, §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK010 Do history requirements and success criteria agree on retention limits and persistence scope? [Consistency, Spec §FR-007, §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK011 Is agent selection terminology consistent across Clarifications, FR-012, and Agent Integration? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, §FR-012, §Agent Integration]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK012 Are acceptance scenarios provided for each user story and mapped to functional requirements? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable with explicit thresholds and time windows? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001–SC-003]
- [ ] CHK014 Is SC-003’s measurement start/stop definition explicitly captured in the requirements? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-003, §Clarifications]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK015 Are alternate flows specified for “no selected text” when the shortcut is pressed? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK016 Are exception flows specified for agent execution failures and malformed outputs? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK017 Are recovery expectations defined after failed translations (retry/reset behavior)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK018 Are slow-response scenarios linked to user-visible behavior or messaging? [Coverage, Spec §SC-002, §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are maximum length or truncation requirements specified for very long selections? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK020 Are requirements defined for empty or malformed agent output handling? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK021 Are requirements defined to preserve existing clipboard contents during selection capture? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK022 Are latency targets specified for both successful and failed translations? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001, §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK023 Are durability expectations defined for history persistence under crash/restart conditions? [Gap, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK024 Are security/privacy requirements defined for locally stored translation history? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK025 Are accessibility requirements defined for keyboard navigation and screen readers? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK026 Are WSLg/environment constraints documented as product assumptions with support boundaries? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK027 Is the dependency on local agent CLI availability explicitly stated in requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK028 Are out-of-scope statements consistent with assumptions (e.g., no cloud services)? [Consistency, Spec §Out of Scope, §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK029 Is the supported set of target languages explicitly defined or intentionally left open? [Gap, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK030 Are prompt length/format constraints specified to avoid ambiguous agent behavior? [Gap, Spec §FR-003, §Agent Integration]
