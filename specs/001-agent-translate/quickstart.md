# Quickstart: Agent Translation App

## Goal
Translate selected text via a global shortcut and view results with history.

## Steps

1. Launch the app in WSLg.
2. Open Settings and configure:
   - Agent command (e.g., Codex/Claude Code/GeminiCLI)
   - System prompt and custom prompt
   - Target language
   - Back-translation toggle (optional)
3. In any app, select text and press the configured shortcut.
   - If the shortcut doesn't respond, check for conflicts with other global shortcuts.
4. Confirm the app displays:
   - Source text (with copy button)
   - Translated text (with copy button)
   - Back-translation (if enabled)
5. Open History to verify past translations are listed and selectable.

## Expected Result
- Translation appears quickly after the shortcut.
- Copy buttons place the correct text on the clipboard.
- History persists across app restarts.
